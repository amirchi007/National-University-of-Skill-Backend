# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* The JVM level was changed from '24' to '21' as the Kotlin version does not support Java 24 yet.
* The original package name 'com.nus.National-University-of-Skill-Backend' is invalid and this project uses 'com.nus.National_University_of_Skill_Backend' instead.
